# Landmark-Detection
Landmark Detections for different applications - Facial, Building, medical etc..

# Facial Landmark Detection

This project demonstrates facial landmark detection using Python and the Mediapipe library. It allows you to detect and visualize the facial landmarks (key points) on an input image.

# Building Landmark Detection

This project aims to perform landmark detection on images of buildings using a dataset containing images and corresponding landmark IDs. The goal is to build a neural network model that can identify different landmarks from the images.

## Dataset and Files

The dataset for this project is available in the following files:
- `train.csv`: Contains the image filenames and their corresponding landmark IDs. 
- `images` folder: Contains the images associated with the filenames in the CSV file.
